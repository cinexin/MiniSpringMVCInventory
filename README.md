README

This project is an example of a "mini-inventory" web application made with Spring (using HSQL Database). This is an eclipse project, but you can import with the IDE you like the most. It runs under Tomcat web server but, like before, you can run it under JBoss or whatever Java Web App Server you want, just making few changes.

The source code is my approach to the Tutorial attached in PDF (SpringMVCTutorial.pdf), so I encourage you to read and follow the guidelines from there (NOTE: the tutorial is written in Spanish language)

Anyway, you can dive into the code, and/or view a demo of the application running in this video: https://vimeo.com/85023374
